# Holtek HT16K33 LED Driver Adafruit Board

My unit is an older model Adafruit backpack purchased circa 2014.

In addition to driving LEDs the chip apparently can perform key scanning.

It is support by the CircuitPython/Blinka library from Adafruit.

## Hardware

The [Holtek HT16K33 Datasheet](https://www.holtek.com/webapi/116711/HT16K33Av102.pdf) is available.
