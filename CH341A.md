# CH341A Programmer

This programmer is supposed to be for programming serial EEPROM chips. I got it for a 
laptop BIOS repair project.

It is based on the [CH341 Chip](https://www.bulcomp-eng.com/datasheet/WCH%20CH341A%20-%20Datasheet.pdf).

I have not used it yet.

Lots of discussions online about 3v/5v versions and compatibility.

It came with a SOIC8 adapter.

## Software
