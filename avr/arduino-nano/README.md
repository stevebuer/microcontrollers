## Programming

I have had this for many years, and at some point put a test program on it -- because it blinks
my callsign in morse code, but it won't load a sketch over serial.

Follow up: I was able to get the bootloader installed by selecting 'Processor: ATmega328P (old bootloader)'
from the Arduino IDE. Now I can upload sketches via serial monitor.

I will solder on the other two pin headers and use this for breadboard projects.
