# Adafruit Trinket

I have the 5V and 3.3V version of these boards in my collection.

## Board Support Package

Is available at: https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json

## Programming

Trying to program but getting error.

Apparently the Adafruit bootloader emulates a USBtinyisp? There is some info about this bootloader
not working as well anymore on Adafruit website. Maybe I can flash this with a different bootloader?
